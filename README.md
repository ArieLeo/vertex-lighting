# vertex-lighting
Vertex Lighting is a Unity 3D Plugin under development by Allan Smith, which to some extent works similarly to Light Probes but with considerably better performance, but also greater limitations.

The system basically uses Vertex Colors to assign colors based on Vertex Lights to models with lots of optimizations, making it ideal for Mobile use. System can currently be seen in use in the game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/like-a-boss/id1055347265?mt=8">Like a Boss</a>, by <a href="http://www.firehorse.com.br/">Fire Horse Studio</a>.

You can also find a link of over 100 agents running around using this plugin, running at 60 fps in an iPhone 5S, in addition to all the AI logic created for Like a Boss in the GIF below.
